# hack-or-snooze
Project for Springboard loosely based on Y Combinator's "Hacker News" application. Built using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript (jQuery, AJAX,  vanilla). 

May need extra functions in order to save a user's favorite stories to Local Storage. Any input is welcome and would be great! Thanks.
